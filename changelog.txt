This extension adds foldable lists and sections to Trello boards, together with per list WiP limits turning your Trello board into a Kanban system.

New in 0.6
====================
- Two bug fixes
-- The first, caused by changes to Trello's DOM, caused "compact mode" and "refresh" buttons to disappear (Issue #37)
-- The second was a timing issue causing section cards to not be drawn correctly as such when added (Issue #36)

New in 0.5
====================
- Bug fixes
- Compact mode (set custom width from popup and enable using "Compact Mode" button
- Added Refresh button (workaround for when board is not rendered correctly)

New in 0.4
====================
- Bug fixes
- Formatting of blocked cards and comment cards
- Added readme.md and website: https://nordmagnus.github.io/Trello-Folds/

New in 0.3
====================
- Added ability to combine two adjacent lists by giving them same prefix ending with a dot. As an example "Develop.In Progress [4]" and "Develop.Ready" will be combined visually and given a combined WiP limit of 4. DISABLED BY DEFAULT IN THIS RELEASE - ENABLE IT IN SETTINGS
- Fixed issue with section viewstates not being restored

New in 0.2
====================
- Added option to always show card count (even for lists without a WiP limit)
- Minor small fixes

Features
