Combine multiple lists:
    ✔ Change data subSet prop ==> subSetIndex, starting with 0 @done(19-09-12 08:39)
    ✔ Make sure every check against subSetIndex is with !== undefined @done(19-09-12 08:39)
    ☐ Detaching height detectors when hiding ==> detached when collapsing :o
    ☐ Make TDOM calls take both $ and element
    ☐ Fix tests
    ☐ Add more unit tests
    ☐ Adding and removing sub lists does not work ;(
